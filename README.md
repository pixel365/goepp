# goepp

`goepp` is a small Go library for parsing and validating EPP (Extensible Provisioning Protocol) XML messages (RFC 5730/5731/5732/5733/5734).

It focuses on protocol-level concerns: decoding command payloads, enforcing basic structural rules, and producing typed command models that can be plugged into an EPP server implementation.

## Status
